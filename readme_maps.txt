In this version I have included only one map ("map1.pm"). Next version will have a map-editor, and more default maps.

However, you can create maps without the map editor:
	map are numbered map*.pm; count must not be broken, otherwise last maps will not be used
	map are in a linear format: a character, in the mapfile, indicates a tile:

	A	blank tile
	B	|_  shape
	C	_|  shape
	D	_| up-down flipped
	E	|_ up-down flipped
	F	_|_
	G	|-
	H	T
	I	-|
	J	+ (cross)
	K	horizontal
	L	vertical

sorry for the messy things about this!
hope you like this game!

and don't forget to vote at PSC, comment, comment, comment, tell me on how to improve this, add powerups, add settings, etc.

bye!
